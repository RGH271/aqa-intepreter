# interpreter for AQA pseudocode

Dynamic interpreter for [AQA Pseudocode](https://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/computing/AQA-8525-NG-PC.PDF) for GCSE and A-Level
This allows you to create a file in AQA pseudocode, that can be ran, to test to make sure it works without having to translate it into a runnable language such as python or c#
It is hugely cobbled together so be prepared for bugs, especially as the program you're trying to run gets increasingly complex

inspired heavily by [slu4's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgsW0eGk-6U)
